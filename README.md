## Abstract

The global film industry, estimated to be worth over $136 billion, represents an intricate tapestry of cultural, economic, and artistic elements. This project delves into the nuanced realms of actor success, movie performance, and the impact of ethnicity and collaboration in the industry. 

Firstly, This research investigates how casting high-profile actors, influences a movie's success and the career trajectory of co-stars. Furthermore, the study explores the effects of an actor's ethnicity on both their personal success and the international reception of their films, considering the evolving global audience demographics. 
The influence of accolades, such as Oscars and Golden Globes, on an actor's subsequent roles and career longevity forms a critical aspect of this analysis. 
Additionally, collaboration with renowned directors and producers is scrutinized for its role in shaping an actor's career, akin to Leonardo DiCaprio's frequent partnerships with Martin Scorsese.

Using comprehensive databases like the CMU Movie Summary Corpus, as well as other sources, this research aims to decode patterns in the careers of successful actors and the evolution of their role choices
